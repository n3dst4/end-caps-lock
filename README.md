# end-caps-lock

Making it easy to disable Caps Lock since 2016. This is the source code for the website [End Caps Lock][site]


## Building and running

## Contributing

You do realise this is the dumbest Sunday afternoon project ever, right? I really just wanted to muck about with a static site generator. But, hey, if you have a great idea to improve [the site][site], feel free to pitch in a pull request!
